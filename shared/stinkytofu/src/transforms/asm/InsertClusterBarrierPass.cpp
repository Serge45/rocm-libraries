        // between completing this iteration's `wait -3` and issuing the next
        // iteration's `signal -3`: a fast wave 0 could race ahead and emit the
        // next-generation `signal -3` while sibling waves in the same workgroup
        // were still draining the current-generation `wait -3`. That extra signal
        // lands in the wrong generation, desynchronizing the cluster barrier's
        // signal/wait count and occasionally deadlocking (the random hang).
        // Placing the workgroup `signal -1`/`wait -1` BETWEEN the cluster
        // `wait -3` and `signal -3` fences the workgroup: every wave must finish
        // the current-generation `wait -3` and converge at the workgroup barrier
        // before wave 0 can issue the next-generation `signal -3`, so no signal
        // is ever emitted into the next generation early. (The legacy
        // signal-before-wait layout self-pairs each iteration's own signal/wait
        // and is left untouched.)

            //   - Ungated wait-before-signal: the loop emits equal
            //     #WAIT and #SIGNAL, so the final in-loop SIGNAL has no in-loop
            //     WAIT to consume it. Rule 5 supplies that trailing WAIT at loop
            //     exit.
            //   - Drain gate ON: the asymmetric gate skips the WAIT at
            //     `LCL <= pgr` and the SIGNAL one stage earlier at
            //     `LCL <= pgr+1`, leaving the loop with exactly one MORE WAIT
            //     than SIGNAL. That extra WAIT already consumes the last
            //     SIGNAL inside the loop, so a Rule 5 WAIT would be unpaired
            //     (one surplus `wait -3`) and would hang. Hence skip Rule 5.
            //   - Ungated signal-before-wait (legacy,
            //     `kRule4SignalBeforeWaitEnabled == true`): each iteration's
            //     SIGNAL is consumed by its OWN trailing WAIT (same-iteration
